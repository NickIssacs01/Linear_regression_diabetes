# Linear_regression_diabetes

This code provides a complete linear regression analysis including:

1. Model building and training

2. Prediction on both training and test sets

3. Model evaluation using RMSE and R² metrics

4. Feature importance analysis with visualization

5. Actual vs Predicted value plots

6. Residual analysis plots


The visualizations will helped in:

- Understanding which features are most important for prediction
- Seeing how well the model fits the data
- Identifying any patterns in prediction errors
- Checking for homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals)

You can interpret the results as follows:

- Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance
- R² values closer to 1 indicate better fit
- The feature importance plot shows which variables have the strongest impact on predictions
- The residual plots should show random scatter around zero for a good model
